# 🛠️ Broken Tool Museum

**A haunted interactive website where nothing works quite right.**

This experimental project explores control, discomfort, and illusion through a series of eerie, broken tools:  
- A notepad that types on its own  
- A calculator that lies  
- A form that will never let you submit  

You’re not alone here.  
You’re not in control.
